Chall : The Functions... THEY ARE OVER 900

1. Have a long string (length slightly over 900) containing several blocks of text
   with a flag hidden inside

2. Have a program that generates 1 C function per character and the call to the check.

Structure :

main
  \
   check_input (checks if input matches initial text)
     \
      check_1 (checks first character)
      check_2 (checks second character)
      check_3 (you get the idea...)
      ...
      check_901 (final check if length of text is 901)
